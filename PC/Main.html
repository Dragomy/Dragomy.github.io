        <h3>Completely switching to Linux. How is it after two weeks? (Posted 11/06/2024, modified 12/06/2024)</h3>
        <p>The final push came when Microsoft announced their recall feature. After updating my system, Edge was back on my desktop. <span class="highlight">Sigh.</span></p>
        
        <p>On my laptop, I switched from Debian to Manjaro because Debian seemed a bit clunky. So, Manjaro it is. I installed it on my PC and, <span class="highlight">wow, everything seems to work.</span> Time to start downloading my Steam library.</p>
        
        <p>But where is my secondary drive that I use for all my games? Oh, it’s simply not mounted. <span class="error">Error: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock.</span> Ok, what's a fs? I asked a friend for help.</p>
        
        <p>His response: "Was für ein FS ist drauf?" ("What FS is on it?"). I realized he meant filesystem. That makes more sense.</p>
        
        <p>Oh, it could be NTFS, the Windows filesystem. Let's use GParted and change it.</p>
        
        <p>Hmm, when I try saving changes from GParted, the window crashes. Well, that’s bad.</p>
        
        <p>I started GParted on my USB stick with the big RAM option. It works... great, first problem solved! Now to mount the drive... yes, that worked too! <span class="highlight">Woohoo!</span></p>
        
        <p>Now that my library was downloaded, I tried starting Satisfactory. The Vulkan shader loading window popped up and then it closed. I tried some other games and... the same thing happened. I went through forums and found out I needed to install through Flatpak. Okay, let me try that. It works.</p>
        
        <p>Satisfactory starts and crashes in the loading screen and cannot be closed, not by System Monitor and I don't know the terminal command. Elden Ring? The BattleEye window starts and that’s it. Dark Souls has 30fps in the EULA screen. But hey, the original Half-Life works.</p>
        
        <p>Ok, I’m running open source drivers with an Nvidia graphics card. Maybe other drivers? I install the drivers, nothing happens.</p>
        
        <p>Ok, maybe a distro that has native Steam/Proton support.</p>
        
        <p>I switched to something more familiar: Pop!_OS (Ubuntu) with KDE Plasma.</p>
        
        <p>No real problems with Pop!_OS. There were some things about gaming. Dark Souls wouldn’t start in fullscreen, but switching to Proton 7.06 fixed that. Thanks to a friend and ProtonDB.</p>
        
        <p>Discord doesn’t support stream audio on Linux (in the app, not the web version), which is a bit sad, but I can live with that.</p>
        
        <p>Now I've experienced but a glimpse of what: "Linux is free if you don't value your time" means. But hey, I like it.</p>

        <h3>Just to get things going (Posted 04/04/2024)</h3>
        <p>Let me present some of my hobbies.</p>
        <h4>PC Building</h4>
        <p>I've planned and assembled seven PCs for both myself, friends and family.</p>
        <p>I have a penchant for repurposing old components; in fact, my latest project—a small server—incorporates old hard drives donated by a friend and the CPU from another.</p>
        <p>While my primary PC currently runs on Windows, I'm proficient with Linux and have already made the switch on my laptop (Debian) and server (Proxmox with several Linux VMs).</p>
        <img class="image" id="DebianLabtop" src="https://dragomy.github.io/assets/img/labtop_desktop.png">
        <p>Here's a glimpse of my Debian-powered laptop with XFCE.</p>
        <img class="image" id="Server" src="https://dragomy.github.io/assets/img/server_v1.png">
        <p>The Server</p>
        <h4>Programming</h4>
        <p>I initially delved into programming with Godot because I aspired to create games. However, my journey expanded when I immersed myself in PC building and explored various facets of the vast IT realm.</p>
        <p>At present, I'm deeply engrossed in the realms of Data Science and Data Analysis.</p>
        <h4>Reading</h4>
        <p>Among German authors, Walter Moers stands as my favorite.</p>
        <p>Choosing a favorite from his works is challenging, but "Die Stadt der Träumenden Bücher" holds a special place in my heart.</p>
