               <p>I'm what some may affectionately call a computer science nerd..</p>
               <p>Currently, I'm a student residing and studying in Germany, I aim to archieve my Abitur next year.</p>
               <p>Programming is among my passions, and I've dabbled in a variety of tools and languages.</p>
               <p>Presently, my primary interests lie in data science, game design, and web development.</p>
               <p>Outside of my tech pursuits, I enjoy assembling PCs, exploring design and art (even though I'm not particularly skilled), constructing with building blocks such as Legos (simply known as "Klemmbausteine" in German), cycling, and more.</p>

               <h3>PC Building</h3>
               <p>I've planned and assembled seven PCs for both myself, friends and family.</p>
               <p>I have a penchant for repurposing old components; in fact, my latest project—a small server—incorporates old hard drives donated by a friend and the CPU from another.</p>
               <p>While my primary PC currently runs on Windows, I'm proficient with Linux and have already made the switch on my laptop (Debian) and server (Proxmox with several Linux VMs).</p>
               <img src="https://dragomy.github.io/assets/labtop_desktop_img.png" width="20%" height="auto">
               <p>Here's a glimpse of my Debian-powered laptop with XFCE.</p>
               <h3>Programming</h3>
               <p>I initially delved into programming with Godot because I aspired to create games. However, my journey expanded when I immersed myself in PC building and explored various facets of the vast IT realm.</p>
               <p>At present, I'm deeply engrossed in the realms of Data Science and Data Analysis.</p>
               <h3>Reading</h3>
               <p>Among German authors, Walter Moers stands as my favorite.</p>
               <p>Choosing a favorite from his works is challenging, but "Die Stadt der Träumenden Bücher" holds a special place in my heart.</p>
