      <p class="WaI"> I'm a student currently living in Germany. Programming being one of my hobbies, I've tipped my toe in a variety of tools and languages such as Java, GDScript (HTML, CSS, and JS), Python and C#. At the moment, I am mostly interested in web development (mostly frontend) and deep learning technology, especially when it comes to picture-generating algorithms like Stable Diffusion and data science. </p>

      <h2>Welcome to my web page!</h2>
      <p>Hello, person reading this. 
    I'm a what some may call a nerd when it comes to computer science. 
    I like data science, building pcs, design and arts (in which I'm not particularly good), programming,  building with Legos and Lego a like (In German what I mean is simply titled "Klemmbausteine"), cycling, and more.
    This site is meant as an addition to my GitHub profile as well as my curriculum vitae and may serve as an additional Attachment in application emails, which maybe been the way you found this site.
    This page is made entirely in my free time and thanks to GitHub costs nothing for me. 
    If you like the site, give it a bookmark and check back on it sometimes. 
    I tend to update the links and stuff on here whenever I get around to it. 
    But sometimes this site may not be upgraded for several months.
    The goal of this website is to be a humorous personal website that is written with at least JavaScript used as possible for me.
    If you see this on mobile something with the redirect does not work, I encountered that problem several times with Apple devices.
    A dedicated mobile site shall be made in the future, you than may find it here. 
    If it looks weird on a desktop platform, something went horribly wrong, it shouldn't. 
    This page was designed and optimized for 1920 pixel by 1080 pixel screens on desktop and laptop computing devices, and tested only in Firefox. </p>
