               <p>I'm a what some may call a nerd when it comes to computer science.</p>
               <p>I'm a student currently living and going to school in Germany.</p>
               <p>Programming being one of my hobbies, I've tipped my toe in a variety of tools and languages.</p>
               <p>At the moment, I am mostly interested in data science, game design and web design.</p>
               <p>Other hobbys of mine are building pcs, design and arts (in which I'm not particularly good), 
                  building with Legos and Lego a like (In German what I mean is simply titled "Klemmbausteine"), 
                  cycling, and more.

               <p>This site is meant as an addition to my curriculum vitae and may serve 
                  as an additional Attachment in application emails, 
                  which maybe been the way you found this site. 
               </p>
               <p>This page is made entirely in my free time and thanks to GitHub costs nothing to host. </p>
               <p>If you like the site maybe check back on it sometimes even if this site may not be updated for several months. </p>
               <p>If you see this on mobile something with the redirect does not work, I encountered that problem several times with 
                  Apple devices.
               </p>
               <p> If it looks weird on a desktop platform, 
                  something went horribly wrong, it shouldn't. 
               </p>
               <p>This page was designed 
                  and optimized for 1920 pixel by 1080 pixel screens on desktop and 
                  laptop computing devices, and tested only in Firefox.
