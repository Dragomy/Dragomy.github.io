        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, person reading this. 
    I'm a what some may call a nerd when it comes to computer science. 
    I like data science, building pcs, design and arts (in which I'm not particularly good), programming,  building with Legos and Lego a like (In German what I mean is simply titled "Klemmbausteine"), cycling, and more.
    This site is meant as an addition to my GitHub profile as well as my curriculum vitae and may serve as an additional Attachment in application emails, which may have been the way you found this site.
    This page is made entirely in my free time and thanks to GitHub costs nothing for me. 
    If you like the site, give it a bookmark and check back on it sometimes. 
    I tend to update the links and stuff on here whenever I get around to it. 
    But sometimes this site may not be upgraded for several months.
    The goal of this website is to be a humorous personal website that is written with at least JavaScript used as possible for me.
